Node js

How node evaluate javascript code.
=> REPL-Read eval print loop(for playing around)
=>CLI(Command line interface) exicutable(importent)

REPL: 
    type 'node' on cmd(you are in repl) 
    its like typing java script in a browser console 
    we can use basic javascript command in it 
    to exit press ctlr+c two times

Start :

create a folder and create a 
javascript file to run the javascrpt 
file we need to write node <name>.js 

GLOBALS - No Window!! 
__dirname = path to current directory 
__filename =  file name 
require = function to use modules (CommonJs)
module = info about current module(file)
process = info about env where the program is being executed
